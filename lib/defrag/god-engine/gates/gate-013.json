  "wisdomText": "Gate 13 is the gate of listening and fellowship. It holds the secrets of human patterns and the direction that comes from understanding those patterns. When stressed, it shows where you're either not listening deeply enough or where your voice/story isn't being heard. The inversion: listen for the pattern, share your truth, and trust that direction emerges from authentic fellowship."
